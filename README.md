# What is my cat thinking ?
## Description
Ever wondered what was your cat thoughts ? Here is the answer !!!
Seriously it is only a small project wich is meant to make me discover how easy API platform is... 
With this project i'm working with my beloved Symfony on API, JWT, and unit test with postman. If i can i'd like to create an integration pipeline with newman and github actions to learn how to work with CI. Might have to use docker for this... we'll see.
Front-End side i'm gonna start simple maybe with bootstrap, webpack encore, or just flex still not sure yet.

PS: I'm tryin to make a well documented project so i get use to be a good collegue !!!

## Installation
